# ABOUT THE PROJECT

## Crop Mapping using Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) and Optical Remote Sensing

Crop growth monitoring is critical for analyzing food production, optimizing landscape use, and contributing to agricultural policy. Remote sensing systems based on optical and/or radar sensors have become a major source of agricultural information. Optical data is related to the chemical qualities of the vegetation, whereas radar data is related to the structure and moisture of the vegetation. Radar can also image the Earth's surface in virtually every weather state

### Difference between Radar and Optical RS

#### Type of Energy

Optical sensing uses visible light and near-infrared light, similar to what a camera or the human eye would see. It can also include other parts of the electromagnetic spectrum like ultraviolet or shortwave infrared.

Radar (Radio Detection and Ranging) sensing, on the other hand, uses radio waves. Unlike optical sensors, radar systems generate their own energy, making them active sensors.

#### Operation Mode

Optical sensors depend on the sun as a source of illumination, meaning they only work during daylight and in clear weather conditions. This is because clouds, smoke, or other atmospheric particles can block the light, hindering the data collection process.

Radar sensors emit their own energy, allowing them to operate independently of daylight or weather conditions. They can collect data day or night, in all weather conditions, including through clouds, rain, or fog. This makes radar a powerful tool for monitoring areas with frequent cloud cover or for applications that require constant monitoring like disaster response.

#### Applications

Optical data is often used in applications such as environmental monitoring (for example, vegetation health, water quality, and land use), climate studies, and earth surface studies. It's commonly used for mapping and monitoring changes over time due to its ability to capture data in color and high resolution.

Radar data has a broad range of applications, including surveillance, navigation, meteorology (weather prediction), and geology (earthquake detection and volcanic activity monitoring). It is also used for studying features and changes in the Earth's surface, and its ability to penetrate clouds and collect data at any time makes it suitable for monitoring natural disasters, tracking ships, or detecting objects or features hidden beneath the Earth's surface.

## About the project

This is an advanced radar remote sensing approaches for crop development monitoring, including polarimetry and a canopy structure dynamic model. It addresses how to use machine learning approaches to classify crop type using Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2 imaging time series. The Sentinel Application Platform (SNAP) and Python code written in Python Jupyter Notebooks, a web-based interactive development environment for scientific computing and machine learning, will be used in this series' practical exercises.
