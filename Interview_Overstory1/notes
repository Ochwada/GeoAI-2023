The traceback you provided suggests that there is an error in the validation of your DataFrame using the pandera package.

Here is an outline of the error:

The validation function validate_client_lines is trying to validate a GeoDataFrame gdf according to some schema ClientLines.

ClientLines.validate(gdf, lazy=True) is called, which attempts to validate the DataFrame gdf according to the defined schema.

Inside the validation process, an error of type SchemaErrors is raised, indicating that there is a schema validation error.

The error message is caught and logged, and then an AssertionError is raised with the message "Validation failed."

Unfortunately, without the ClientLines schema definition and the DataFrame gdf, it's difficult to specify what exactly went wrong. However, based on the error message, here are some possible causes:

One or more columns in the DataFrame gdf does not adhere to the schema specified in ClientLines. Check the schema for requirements, such as the type of data each column should contain, or specific values allowed in columns.

The phasingType column of gdf does not contain only the values 'single-phase', 'two-phase', and 'three-phase'. This could be due to an unexpected value or a typo in the data.

There might be a data type inconsistency in gdf. For instance, a column could contain mixed types, such as strings and integers together.

It's also possible that there are missing or extra columns in gdf that aren't accounted for in the ClientLines schema.

You should inspect both your DataFrame and the ClientLines schema carefully to identify where the discrepancy lies. One way to debug this might be to validate each column of gdf individually against the ClientLines schema, to identify the problematic column. If the error lies in the values, you might want to check the unique values in the columns for any anomalies.



_____________________
This is a Python class ClientLines that inherits from SchemaModel, and it is used to define a schema for validating a GeoPandas DataFrame (or simply a DataFrame with geographical data).

Let's break it down:

The class-level variables geometry, level3, level1, level2, and phasingType are field definitions for the DataFrame schema. Each of these variables corresponds to a column in the DataFrame, and the type and constraints of these columns are defined using pandera's Series and Field classes.

geometry: This is a required column containing geometry data.

level3: This is a required column of type str, and all values in this column must be unique.

level1 and level2: These are optional columns of type str, and they can contain null values.

phasingType: This is also an optional column of type str, it can contain null values, and its values must be one of "single-phase", "two-phase", or "three-phase".

The Config subclass is used to define additional configuration settings for the SchemaModel. Here it is setting a name, a description, and requiring all column names to be unique.

The geometry_is_valid and geometry_is_linestring methods are custom checks that are applied to the geometry column.

The geometry_is_valid method checks that all the geometries in the geometry column are valid geometries.

The geometry_is_linestring method checks that all the geometries in the geometry column are of type "LineString".

The dataframe_in_utm method is a DataFrame-level check that ensures the DataFrame's Coordinate Reference System (CRS) is in the Universal Transverse Mercator (UTM) format. This is done by comparing the estimated UTM CRS to the DataFrame's actual CRS.

In short, this class is used to define a schema that can validate a DataFrame to ensure it has the correct structure, and that its data is of the correct type and satisfies certain conditions. This can be very useful when dealing with large and complex datasets, as it allows you to catch errors and inconsistencies in your data early on.
